quote: |
  “It’s always been an emotional response to the concepts of fear and control. I thought that simply the symbolism of cutting my hair would bring this sort of reawakening to my life [control]. In a sense it did, but as I am now on my third cut I realize my own responsibility in this hair journey. It’s more than just the act of cutting, it’s what comes after that [fear]. After the first cut I realized it would take more than just owning the look, I had to own every part of myself as well. You gain patience with your internal self when “recreating” your outer self.
