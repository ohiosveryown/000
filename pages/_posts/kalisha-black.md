  “When I decided to embrace my natural hair publicly it was a major challenge for me. I HATED everything about my hair, the dislike list was so long. It represented both of what I did not like about myself and the lack of knowledge of my own hair. In the beginning, I would style my hair the best I could, but I could not force myself to open my own front door. This would result in me crying because I could not believe that I couldn’t accept myself with natural hair. Three years later, the fear is gone and my love for my natural hair is endless. I love the bad hair days & the good ones, wash day, and rainy days... I love the lifestyle that comes with being natural, it represents so much more than just hair for me.
