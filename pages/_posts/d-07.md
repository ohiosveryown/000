quote: |
  â€œMy hair is important to me because it tells the story of my heritage. As a Black-American woman, I do not know where my ancestors came from, so to me my hair tells the story of my ancestors. It is my curly, coiled and thick crown that represnets, where my people come from. I am a melting pot of multiple peoples, from multiple lands... and I am proud to reflect that."
