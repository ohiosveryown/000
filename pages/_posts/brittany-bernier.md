  “I like how spontaneous my hair can be, sometimes I like to be very well put together, and allowing my hair to be free, allows me to be more optimistic and not limit my style. I like to think my hair has it’s own personality. Naturally it does. The only thing I dislike about my hair is how terribly it tangles, but at the same time I appreciate having to care for it when it gets to that level.
