  â€œIt took a long time for me to build this relationship with my hair. When I was very young, I did not love the texture of my hair. It was not necessarily something I got from my home, but rather media and the anti-blackness that permeates in our society. I spent a long time damaging my hair to look like what I believed was acceptable at the time--stick straight hair. This changed when I began wearing protective hair styles and slowly started seeing my hair grow and become healthier than it had ever been. I love my hair because I took time investing in a relationship with it.
