  “As my child, she knows she can be a pain sometimes. There are days when I treat her like the princess she is and still get a temper tantrum in the morning. We’ve both agreed that Bantu knots are not our thing. It’s fine! And I’ve learned to give her 2-days notice of a drastic switch or else she will not cooperate. Our relationship took time to build and definitely wasn’t overnight. If you’re interested in going natural remember its a marathon. Not a sprint. Your hair is not always going to turn out like every lady on YouTube.
